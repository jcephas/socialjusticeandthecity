Throughout this semester and the readings we have done, along with our interactive analyses, I have been keen on the notion that everyone should get out and vote, but it is not that simple.  Accessibility of voting polls becomes the focal point of this final project.  Now more than ever there seems to be an increased level of attention being paid to the voting process.  Everything, in my opinion, can be altered through the act of voting, so it is important to get as many people as possible to vote so that their voices can be heard.  Architects and the way we design and build our infrastructure systems can have a direct and positive impact on the future of voting, especially in urban areas.

Below I have shown a graph that maps out each countries score for human rights, and their political regime type, full autocracy to full democracy.  The human rights shows how well each citizen is protected.  We can start to dive into each of these countries research as to why they are receiving higher or lower scores.  The United States, while receiving a decent human rights score is still well below other countries such as Norway or Luxembourg, which have the highest human rights rankings.
