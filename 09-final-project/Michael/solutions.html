<p>
The voting process should be simple, convenient, and fair to all, but as we know, for many, that process is not so simple due to the many hindrances that people face on a day to day basis, and even more so, to vulnerable or suffering communities.  Solutions have been offered to combat voting suppression and implement voting reforms. 
</p>


<p>
In regard to voting reform, the Automatic Voter Registration Act system has been gaining traction among various states and the public.  It allows eligible voters to be automatically registered whenever they interact with a government agency, such as the DMV.  As of December 23, 2020, 20 states and the District of Columbia had enacted automatic voter registration policies.  Other solutions have been to expand early voting, which would set minimum requirements for federal elections, allowing people to have ample amounts of time and opportunities to vote, which in turn leads into the next solution, preventing long lines at polls.  With the expansion of early voting, less people will need to vote on election day, but it goes farther than that.  Ensuring that polling places have enough working machines, workers, and resources to properly conduct a vote will be essential in a smooth simple voting process.  
</p>

<p>
Voter suppression solutions have focused on protecting citizens through the passing and implementation of new laws.  These laws will look to protect eligible voters from improper purges, and deceptive election practices.  The Deceptive Practices and Voter Intimidation Prevention Act has been brought forward to protect Americans from tactics that intimidate voters and prevent them from exercising their right to vote on Election Day.
