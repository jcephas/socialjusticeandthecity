			<p>According to a report from Geotab, <b>Boston ranks as having one of the lowest amounts of green space per resident among major U.S. cities.</b> Boston residents only have <b>168</b> square feet of green space per person. The distribution of green spaces in Boston is also not balanced. Mattapan and Hyde Park have <b>30%</b> tree coverage, while lower-income East Boston and Roxbury have <b>only seven percent and nine percent</b>, respectively. For the people in the South End and East Boston, there is around one acre of green space per 1,000 people and in Back Bay-Beacon Hill, the residents have approximately six acres of green space.
			 </p>

			 <p>Based on a study across more than 100 cities, redlined neighborhoods are five degrees hotter in summer than areas once favored for housing loans, with some cities experiencing a temperature <b>increase of 12 degrees</b>. Low-income communities with Black and Hispanic residents are more likely to have fewer trees and parks that help cool the air, and these spaces also have more paved surfaces, such as asphalt lots or nearby highways, that absorb and radiate heat.</p>

			 <p>Creating more green spaces also encourages safer living conditions. Residents of public housing living near trees and natural landscapes reported <b>25%</b> fewer domestic aggression and violent acts. Public housing buildings with significant vegetation had <b>52%</b> fewer total crimes, 48% fewer property crimes, and 56% fewer violent crimes than buildings with low proximity to vegetation. For example, Roxbury is an area with less green coverage and ranks as the second most dangerous neighborhood in Boston. In Roxbury, there are <b>104%</b> more crimes than Boston as a whole, and 1,271 violent crimes per 100,000 people. Beyond lowering the crime rate, developing more green spaces and parks can create more job opportunities. According to the National Recreation and Parks Association analysis of Massachusetts, funding on park operations creates 23 jobs for every $1 million spent and funding on parks capital improvements creates 16 jobs for every $1 million spent. Based on the analysis of the Economic Impact of Local Parks in the state of Massachusetts, over one billion dollars of economic activity was generated by local parks and recreation, local parks and entertainment supported 8,604 jobs, and over four hundred million dollars in salaries were generated due to local parks and recreation.</p>
