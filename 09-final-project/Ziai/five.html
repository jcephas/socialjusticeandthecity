	<p>Racial segregation and racial discrimination have always been a problem in the United States, and this problem has existed since the 1800s. The four reading materials gave a detailed introduction to racial zoning and how it affects people of color and society. Racial segregation can be shown by housing discrimination. The people of color need to experience the redline zoning policy, the unfair housing mortgage policy, and people of color cannot buy houses located in a better location and have good services. What's more, racial segregation also leads to school segregation. The next generation of people of color cannot enjoy good educational resources. Under this situation, I think housing discrimination is one reason people of color lag behind white people. They have been denied the resources that white people have enjoyed for their children, which causes a considerable wealth gap between people of color and white people.</p>

	<p>The designers would design the highway next to where most people of color live instead of next to them with people community. And the site where people of color living in has less green space; they have to experience polluted air, water, and even the higher temperature. Their health is also greatly affected by the environment in which they live. Although people are beginning to advocate racial equality in today's society, I still feel the racial segregation and racial discrimination exist nowadays. The living environment and the social services between people of color and white people are still not balanced.</p>
