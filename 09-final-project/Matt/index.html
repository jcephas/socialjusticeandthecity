				<h5>the architect and the place</h5>

				<div id="body1">
					<p> <b>T</b>he architect and the planner have long been thought of one of the primary drivers of the progression of the built environment, and at times cultural production in general. In my mind, this is a short-changing of the power and value of the architect in the modern world. In <i>The Right to the City</i>, Henri  Lefebvre writes that <b style="font-size:14px"><i>“the architect […] cannot out of nothingness create new forms and relations. More precisely, the architect is no more a miracle worker than the sociologist.”</i></b> (Lefebrve 150-151) This is due to the simple fact that in our world, nothingness does not exist spatially. There will always be existing fabrics at work in a place, be they social, environmental, or cultural. Therefore, when engaging with a place spatially architects will always have the choice whether to create a productive and equitable dialogue with the “nothingness” or ignore it. </p>

					<p>States constructed notions of cadastral maps to give a sense of order and rigidity to the life that exists in the “nothingness”. (Scott 2) These political divisions of land influence the production of architecture, as for better or worse, architects are often allied with power. Frequently in our post-industrial world, power is concentrated in the states. Architects then have the implicit tendency to be unwilling agents of state agenda, crafting lenses to perceive the world and being tempted to view all through that top-down lens which may miss the essential qualities of the local. (Scott 7) This is a manner of practice that many architects work under. The knowledge of architects is deployed unto a site from a pedestal which suggests, whether through implication or intention, apartness and superiority.</p>

					<p> <b>H</b>owever, there remains an alternative path forward for the relationship between architects and the field upon which they work. Mistrust of architects and other “experts” is rampant in the world. Design practiced with “a profound appreciation for the local” (Citizen Architect) as opposed to enforcing top-down plans with little input from those that directly effect it can and will increase the health and happiness of people, both physical and mental. After all, <b style="font-size:14px"><i>“citizens [will feel they] have the right to decide and control the future of their built environment.”</i></b>(Crockett 1) Working with people in the first place in partnership can avoid clashes and disruptions of the life that takes place around sites of contention. For example, the para-architecture organization ARCH practiced this appreciation for the local by generating plans for schools and other community uses that were disregarded by the city. This led to the community occupation of Reclamation Site #1 at 125th street in Harlem. (Goldstein 92) </p>

					<p>People have a right to have a say in what aspects of themselves that make up the physical enviornment that surrounds them. Cities, thus, are reflections of the people that live in them as opposed to programs that engineer people into a definition of society. What matters is <b style="font-size:14px"><i>“what is seen and what can be said about it, around who has the ability to speak, around the properties of spaces and possibilities of time.”</i></b>(Ranciere 13) It is logical then to suggest that architects can and should serve as the bridge linking the people of a place to the power of a state. Architects have an implicit skill of integration and understanding, and should cease to view the general public as barriers and more as partners.(Ward 17) Mutual enrichment of both the production, and spirit of both the archictect and community can be gained when we view communities as allies and partners instead of enemies to be defeated.
