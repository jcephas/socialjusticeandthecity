    <h1>About</h1>

        <body>
            <p id="intro">This website was developed as a final project for ARCH 6340: Social Justice & the City - Race, Space & Ethics in Architecture & Urbanism. A series of ineractive components are implemented in order to explore the relationship between the body, race, and identity. In particular, how they are influenced by landscape and architecture, as these entities are the foremost characteristics in which we engage our environments. Although informative, this website also intends to engage the user in considering their own persona or identity in relation to the spaces in which they take up and find comfort, or maybe even discomfort in. Based on an synthesis of the course material the author, Emma Palacio, explores how people and communities can achieve empowerment through architecture.</p>

            <p id="about">Emma is a candidate for a Master's degree in architecture at Northeastern University and holds a Bachelor of Science in Historic Preservation from Temple University. Growing up in Philadelphia, Emma is interested in the development of cities and their infastructure, along with the historcal implications of buildings. In addition to this, Emma is intrigued by the dynamics between people and architecture as both a concept and individual relationship. Emma believes that architecture is often more personal than considered therefore, its knowledge and systems should be accessible to the public.</p>
