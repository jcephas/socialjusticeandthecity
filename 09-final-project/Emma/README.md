# final-project
 
Using the concepts we’ve discussed throughout the course and the skills you have developed in our digital media workshops, you will create a website that clearly and succinctly communicates an idea, event, or concept related to ethical practices in the design of architecture, landscape architecture, and/or urban design and planning. Think of this website as your attempt to communicate a small but compelling portion of our discussion and insight to a broader public. 

You are free to decide what and how much to communicate, as long your site adheres to the following user story:

I can view text and images illustrating an idea, event, or concept related to ethical practices in built environment design.
I can click to view information on at least three separate pages.
I can view and interact with at least one interactive diagram.
I can view and interact with a dynamic map.
I can view citations for the material referenced (such as articles and films).
I can view information about the author/creator of the site (that’s you!). 

Be sure that the ideas you are conveying on your website are organized and well articulated. There should be a clearly identified thesis—that is, a succinct and non-obvious concept linking together the material on the site. Use this as an opportunity to dig further into the material presented and take a position regarding race, ethics, social justice, and the built environment.
