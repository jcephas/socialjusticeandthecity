        <h2>Freedom of Expression</h2>
            <p id="text">One concept that is particularly distinctive in this reading is the desire to create an identity for a specific landscape. As we have seen before, the social movement has been an important agent for achieving alternate identities through individuals. However, Goldstein touches upon how the character of a space is often tied to those that live there. This concept enforces the high importance of the spatial landscape.</p>

            <p id="text">The readings also discuss how identity is both associated with and objectified by these landscapes. Therefore, identity and place or sense of place holds a similar intertwined relationship to that of race and the body. Although neither of these paired relationships are isolated from one another. One of the main points that stuck out to me was the notion that people can feel a strong sense of identity through the areas and communities in which they live in. A quote that surprised me was, “Our duty to ourselves and to those with whom we come in contact is to show the world that we are an advanced people, that we are law-abiding and respectable and that we are able to care for the property we control or occupy.”. Thus, there is a fine line between finding empowerment through collective neighborhoods and being harmed by their implications. However, these implications are enforced by this standard of Whiteness that was created out of opposition to other groups of people.</p>

            <p id="text">The comparison between the Black Belt, Chinatown, and the U.S.-Mexico Border brings up crucial points within their subjectification. Although formed out of different circumstances the associations and structures formed around them highlight the different stereotypes that surround each group of people. Specifically, there is a capitalistic undertone to each of these associations. For example, many interview accounts in Selections from Black Metropolis show how Black people were often objectified for their labor, while a similar trend can be understood in The Homeland, Aztlan. This however is not the case described in The Idea of Chinatown. Anderson argues that the creation of the idea behind Chinatown instilled associations of unsanitary and undesirable lifestyles, which contrasts sharply with the more tangible landscape implications that are found in the Black Belt and U.S.-Mexico Border. These initial differences within subjectification have led to further pitfalls and divides between different racial groups today.</p>

    <div id="section2" style="display:none">
        <h2>The Disciplinary Alibi & Architectural Education</h2>
            <p id="text">Understanding the relationship between landscape and social justice, along with Cordingley’s account on Can masdeu raises many challenges and questions within the architectural profession. A shift in education is also supported by these issues. More time should be put into learning about other ways of life, instead of the content being surrounded solely by buildings themselves. Architectural education should be a balance between learning about people and learning about buildings.</p>

            <p id="text">The success of Bond and ARCH’s work leads me to believe that the professional world of architecture is long overdue for restructuring. It also points to the fact that architecture is more than just understanding buildings, their systems, and theory. Therefore, it is also important that architectural education is restructured. The divide between politics and aesthetics in architecture has led to the separate nature of architecture and community development.</p>

            <p id="text">The main concept that I took away from this reading is that architecture should be about using its tools and methodologies in conjunction with understanding the human condition in order to achieve freedom. As lefebvre states, only those who are exploited truly understand these systematic struggles can create change within communities. This idea is further supported by the successes that are described by Cowan, Lakeman, Leis, Lerch, and Semenza. Their chapter asserts that architecture should be built by the people for the people. In extension to these rights to the city it is also critical for architectural knowledge to be public and accessible.</p>
