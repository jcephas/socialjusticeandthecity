					<p>In the 19th century, perspectives on nature took a dramatic 180, with the wilderness no longer considered a wasteland, instead becoming a cathedral of god's incredible power. Understanding wilderness through this context led to the conservation movement being born, and the larger environmental movement as well. The wilderness was a place where one can be free from the pollution and dirt of industrialized culture, taking refuge in green spaces dedicated for the trees and animals, never to be sullied by the touch of human beings.</p>

					<p>Of course, this made wilderness not an eyesore on society, but a luxury, and as such it was reserved for those who had the means to access it. Places like the Yosemite Valley and Yellowstone were only accessible with those who could afford to go on a month long trek to these places. Not to mention that the illusion of being "untouched by human hands" projected a landscape that lacked the indigenous people who cultivated it for millenia. The result has been a landscape that lacks the checks and balances of traditional ecological knowledge, resulting in spaces that are green, but in danger.</p>
