					<p>Through William Cronon's The Trouble with Wilderness, we can begin to understand how Western civilization has contextualized "natural" spaces and begin to understand how we got to where we are today. The West's relationship with the natural world has been complicated since it first defined itself as something different from nature itself. Historically, wilderness was synonymous with the idea of wastelands and desolated areas. Wilderness was something humans were meant to eliminate, to replace the ancient oaks with fields of grain.</p>

					<p>Wilderness was something to be feared, as many people viewed the vast stands of woods as realms of the unknown, where demons or the devil himself might reside. As such, wilderness was interpreted as a hostile entity, and human intervention in the landscape was dedicated to controlling it and strictly managing it. Forests became meadows, wooded areas were managed for preserving game, and even trees themselves would be pruned, coppiced, and cloned for aesthetics that would hold well in gardens.</p>
