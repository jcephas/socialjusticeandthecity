String s = "After finished reading the two articles, the first feeling comes to my mind is as the time progressed, some consciousness has also changed. Calhoun talked about the social movements in his article and Ranciere talked about the politics and aesthetics. In Calhoun’s book, he stated that “the social movement was a form of collective organization transposable across issues and populations that was used by ordinary people to express a variety of claims, grievances, and aspirations and to do so often with little stimulus or guidance from above.” (page.43, Calhoun) In my opinion, I think social movement is a way and a chance for the public people to effectively communicate their ideas about the current society to leaders at the top. Ranciere points out in his article that the distribution of sensibility is an aesthetic enterprise, and that it is aesthetics that has a stake in any politics. “We are all equal” was his political idea. These two articles make me naturally have some connection with what I have learned in the previous classes. The first thing that comes to my mind is racial inequality, Racial discrimination is not an idea that grows out of the public psyche; officials and organizers also promote this idea to the public. The idea of racial inequality is totally opposite to the idea of “we are all equal.” What’s more, the reactions of how minority people against the idea of racial inequality can be seen as a kind of social movement.
