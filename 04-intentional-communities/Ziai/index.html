	<p id="one" > This week’s article and the film present two version of building a utopian city. Paolo Soleri built his utopian city in the desert starting in the year of 1970. The concept of this utopian city is to have a new form of city making with density and proximity to nature. There does not have the concept of roads, streets. People do not need to have cars in this city. This utopian city is a kind of mix the architecture and the nature together. People can feel a different lifestyle here, and they can have a feeling of included. Producer recorded Tollas family in the year of 2000 and 2014, the little has grown up. He stands for the new generation in this utopian city.  </p>


	<p id="one"> Soler’s utopian city started to build in 1970. Goldstein’s black utopia was happened in the late 1960s. The start data were very close, but their way and goals to build the city were totally different. Goldstein stated an organization called ARCH (Architects’ Renewal Committee in Harlem) in the very beginning of the article. ARCH tried to increase minority representation among those who determined urban form. They wanted to create new routes by which Harlemites could shape their community. Goldstein stated that “The black city would be like a very rich fabric, with multicolor threads running through it. a great mix of housing, social facilities, and working places, rather than a series of distinct zones, each separate, each pure, each Puritanical.” The goal of building the black utopia was to build something meaningful on the site, and something beneficial to the community. As well as the primary concern of the redevelopment design for Harlem was for the Human Beings who live here now. Harlem residents elected to fulfill their most acute needs in the very heart of their neighborhood, underscoring their desire that Harlem’s spaces and structures reflect its predominantly African American, low-income population. </p>



	<p id="one"> The first feeling after watched the film about Soler’s utopian city was that this city would bring people a new lifestyle. People can escape the city and enjoy nature. However, the first feeling after read the article about the black utopia was that the redevelop of Harlem was to try to meet people's needs as much as possible and let residents in Harlem have the right to control their city’s design. </p>
