					<p>"Arcosanti" introduces the experimental utopian town in the Arizonian desert, conceptualized by architect Paolo Soleri, his principle of arcology, and the collaborating with many like-minded individuals.  In "Black Utopia," Goldstein discusses the activism of Black and low-income Harlem residents as they recognized the power dynamics of urban planning, challenged design education norms, and demanded the right to envision their neighborhood built for themselves. </p>
					<p>Both visions embrace the creativity and desires of its intended residents, laboring to define a settlement that is supportive of its community and health. The possibility of democratized design is explored at both locations.  However, the two conceptions are diametrically opposed.  Arcosanti was built from the escapist inclinations of socially mobile individuals; Harlem was reimagined by and for socially oppressed peoples within the existing urban landscape.  Arcosanti invents arcology; Harlem celebrates blackness. </p>
					<p>The relationship of the two spaces in relation to their surroundings and context are drastically contrasting.  Rather than engaging with technologies of local indigenous vernacular architecture such as wickiups or pueblos that already practice sustainable settlement in the dry heat of Arizona, Arcosanti is an architect's vegetated concrete utopia.  The creation and emphasis on "arcology" overlooks existing built forms that already occur at the intersection of architecture, landscape, ecology, and community.  </p>
					<p>In contrast, the plan of Harlem facilitated by the community-based organization ARCH works within the urban social context, seeking to preserve characteristic urban forms while replacing deteriorated structures.  The significance of the design participants' identities is not overlooked.  As a result, a vibrant neighborhood can emerge without being assimilated and depersonalized by the the larger power structure.  Still, both Arcosanti and Harlem encourage fascinating discussion and provide important case studies on what the urban spaces should look like, who should design them, and who gets to inhabit them.	</p>
