        <h3>Analysis</h3>

        <p id="text1">These two readings discuss the ways in which architects have failed to design for communities, while the film Citizen Architect describes how designers have successfully built for them. Ward brings up critical points in the division between architects and those who they design for. For example, he states, “the missing political element is the politics of participation, of user control and of self-managing, self-regulating communities.” [2]. Through this quote we can begin to see how the institutionalization of architecture as an entity and profession has led to its elitist nature. This fact leads me to question the ways in which we can close this gap. The film poses as one strong example for how architects can begin to empower communities. It also touches on some of the ways in which we can begin to reshape how architecture is taught. A combination of technical skills and deep personal engagement provided a successful method for understanding the best ways to support these people. A few other questions this text made me consider are how can we reshape society and its politics through architecture, and how can we empower and equip people to think about architecture?</p>

        </nav>

        <p id="text2">Roth’s text additionally draws our stark contrasts between the real and idealized nature of architecture. He states, “part of the mystique of the superstar architects was their globetrotting, for they worked everywhere.” [3]. In this quote, he points out that another problem with architecture is that the lack of localized architects has led to harm within communities as designers do not fully understand what these people are fighting for. Both of these readings also suggest the selfish nature of architecture. The idea of architects being seen as “celebrities” or designing for the sole purpose of impressing their colleagues points to another irony within architecture.</p>

        <h3>The Disciplinary Albi & Architectural Education</h3>

        <p>These ideas link back to the disciplinary alibi and can be traced back to the way architecture is taught. Architectural education is notorious for long studio hours and lack of sleep. This overload of work does not provide opportunities for students to think about who they are, this is especially true if architectural education is undertaken during the ages of 18-25. This age range is critical for self development and exploration therefore, external stressors, such as a high workload, can hinder one’s ability to fully make time for themselves.</p>
