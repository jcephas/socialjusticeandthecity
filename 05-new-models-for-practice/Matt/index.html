						<p> To, me, one of the most compelling aspects of the reading today serves as concrete and real examples of the four ethical principles that we have discussed thus far in class. Both separatist, utopian communities that were examined (the area around 125th street in Harlem and Arcosanti) embraced a democratic dissemination of information to bring an alternative vision for the use of space into reality, albeit with several key differences. Goldstein’s Black Utopia detailed the struggles of the black and Puerto Rican community of Harlem in having a hand in the development of space in their community. Easy parallels can be drawn to the work of the Young Lords that we have previously examined, but with the key difference of the extent to which the community worked to bring their vision to reality. Harlemites occupied a piece of community land and manifested their new vision into reality to put on display, a step beyond the work of the Young Lords. This represented as well a crucial example of Scott’s notion that one of the final blockers of authoritarian, undemocratic planning is a complicit and inactive civil populace. </p>

						<p> On the other hand, Arcosanti was responding less to exclusion and more strictly to perceived societal ills. While the Harlemites were agitating to make their needs and the positive elements of their community legible, Arcosanti developed a set of principles and draped them onto a “empty” landscape. In this way, it can be argued that the development was using the top-down planning of the day in an alternative manner. Nonetheless, both organizations settled on a path forward of creating a space set apart to realize a prototype of their ideals. Importantly, this step forward in physical action was also coupled with an acceleration of more intellectual ideas regarding the ability for a wide variety of people to participate in the shaping of the built environment. </p>

						<p>  Both example communities identified issues with the environments that they were living in and partnered with average members of the community using the tools of power to bring alternative visions of space into reality. In Harlem, ARCH trained members of the community in the design and planning skills that were being deployed against them as a means of speaking the language of power, to power. Conversely, Arcosanti appeared to embrace a wholly collectivist attitude in which credentials were eschewed, and decisions were made with largely equal voice. </p>
