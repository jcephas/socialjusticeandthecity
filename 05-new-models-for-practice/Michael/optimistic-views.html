<h1>Optimistic Views</h1>
	<h4>Michael Lydon</h2>

	<p>
		These readings discuss how architecture as a profession is changing.  architecture, today, is availing to itself more design freedom, strategies and methods to explore, which previously had gone unexplored, and even open up opportunities to work pro bono for causes that are charitable or engaging within a community.  This, in part, is due to the constant technological advances and A.I., but the reading poses the question of whether or not high modernism equates to better living.  Architecture intrinsically is a profession that relies on social involvement and natural studies, but it seems that throughout the years architecture has lost sight of that very notion.  Architecture has fallen victim to the "elitist group" and it is normative for us to believe that there are only a few individuals who are "gifted enough" to design and build.  This is actively suppressing new discoveries, inventiveness, and overall imagination.

		"The minority dissident approach is to see the architecture as a popular social activity, where the architect is an enabler, or fixer, rather than an aesthetic dictator." - (Ward - 24)
	</p>

		Architecture should look toward public involvement and discussions to provide answers in a cohesive manner rather than look to oppress the average citizen.  In Ward's reading they discussed that "over 90% of the world's dwellings were built by their inhabitants, without benefit of architects... using with incredible ingenuity, the materials that came to handâ€¦" (Ward - 26).  This was an interesting, and honestly, overlooked point, one that I personally do not even think about.  Perhaps architecture has become too exclusive of a profession, and should return back to its natural roots. However, it is not always up to the architect to be able to single handedly accomplish this.  Most of the time architects themselves are suppressed because they too work for someone.  In "Cult of the High Profile Architect", by Emery Roth, the point of ethics and morals were brought up.  Throughout the 20th century large buildings were built up in cities as a way to make a "statement of power and wealth" (Roth - 560) to the rest of the world.   Buildings erected during this time, for the most part seemingly, rejected the opportunity to include the surrounding community and to engage with the street and encourage pedestrian activity.  I believe that is where the question of ethics and morals comes into play.  The pedestrian, especially the local, should have a larger say in what happens in their neighborhood, which I believe now has gotten better, but there is still room for improvement.

		Overall, as a future architect, I am excited about the future of the profession.  I think we are on an upward trend of involvement and continue to develop more design strategies that focus on community involvement as well as urban sustainability and green efforts.
