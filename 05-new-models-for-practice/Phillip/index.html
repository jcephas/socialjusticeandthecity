		<h1>1. Issues</h1>
		<p>A compilation of lectures addressing the architecture profession by Colin Ward exposes several issues within the design profession. Roth in the article “Cult of High Profile architect” examines similar problems stemming from a narcissistic approach idolizing some big name Architects possibly because of self promotion in the first place. These issues pose a larger problem when trusted to build towards the vernacular or for the people. The changing landscape for the profession must shift from the “independent profession” that enable bureaucratic decision making and lend itself towards as Geoffrey Vickers describes “skilled understanders enabling people to work out there problems”.

		<h1>2. Ideology</h1>
		<p>The bureaucratic processes of the past only have further enabled ideologies that have separated and segregated communities. The architect does have a place for the wealthy or those seeking artistic form, but it should not be misinterpreted as a single entity capable of producing such craft. Architects possess skillsets that do involve that of aesthetic nature and a desire towards recognition, however, departure from this self/ego centric approach brings the designer towards community and production through the eyes of the community.

		<h1>3. Rural Studio</h1>
		<p> In citizen architect Sambo created the Rural Studio which embodied this departure. Students worked and engaged with the clients and generated designs based around the personality of those who will live within the structure. This interaction and engagement is what has been missing in modern architecture as Colin Ward pointed out in his lectures. By listening to Music Man and interpreting his life into a built form based off of these interactions a successful, integrated form can be born. There is a place for architects for large aesthetic buildings given they bring together a cultural representation of artform, but more importantly an architect works must engage with those who utilize it. Without this understanding, as noted in the two readings and the film, an architect’s identity will continue to be criticized for its lack of understanding.</p>

		<h1>4. Messy Reality</h1>
		<p>Ivan Illich described professionalization as a “disorder that rests on the illusion that the knowledge of the individual is of less value that the ‘knowledge’ of science’. (Ward, 20) Architecture is as much aesthetic as it is social, and therefore the citizen holds the knowledge. The rural studio was described as messy at times which resembles reality. As professionalization produces work that is perfected it too should acquire an ability to adapt and transform with new discoveries. </p>
