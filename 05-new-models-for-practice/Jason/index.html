					<p>As Modernism challenged the world of architecture by asking the question “what would the world of architecture look like if we rejected the classical foundations which led us here,” the contemporary question surrounding the field focuses less on the identity of the architecture, and more on how we perceive and interact with the architect themselves.</p>

					<p>Roth’s entry delved into the celebrity associated with the “starchitect,” an architect who views themselves with the same artistic genius and bravado as figures like Salvador Dali or Mick Jagger, viewing themselves as artists, not as builders. While championed by Peter Eisenmann, this view of “the architect” is challenged by Sam Mockbee in Citizen Architect, who founded his firm, not as a means of gaining notoriety or as an inflation of his own ego, but as a means of service to the communities which he grew up in. </p>

					<p>This change is one which decides to subvert the expectation of a top-down approach, in which architects can design for people whom they’ve never met or listened to, communicating with only those who are funding their projects directly, communicating the architects vision of space and design in a manner that belittles and patronizes the stakeholders who will make use of it. The bottom-up approach, one which Mockbee favored and is highlighted by William Tatton-Brown in “Talking to Architects,” when he says “delegate responsibility as low down as possible, give it to the people nearest to the patients,” demonstrates a favoring of accounting for those most affected by the architect’s work first, and having those stakeholders as the primary voices in guiding how the design should function.</p>

					<p>I think that this recontextualization of “the architect” is incredibly important in a world that has become increasingly inequitable. As neoliberalism, classism, racism, and xenophobia, more professions need to redefine themselves as vectors to build empathy, community, and work in service of others. Architects (and artists for that matter) need to stop viewing themselves as merely occupying a bubble afforded to them by high society’s recognition of their “brilliance” or “talent,” and must instead use the power they wield and the influence they have to democratize their profession and mitigate the injustices created in this imbalanced world.</p>
