<h1>Project Can Masdeu</h1>

<p>
	The Project Can Masdeu represented the consistent effort of a community, and group of people with similar goals coming together to bring life back into the landscape. They fought individualism, with collectivism and dependence through autonomy.  This was presented to me in the reading, Can Masdeu - Rise of the Ruban People, by Luke Cordingley.  Considered to be a squatter and therefore a temporary project, this project showcased how a community came together, with different generations, and communicated with each other on issues they were consistently facing.

	Project Can Masdeu survived initial eviction attempts by the owners and city government, through passive and peaceful resistance methods.  "Okupas" or climbers, resisted police and awaited for a judge rulings, who ruled in favor of them; they would to continue their mission.  As they progressed forward they adjusted their approach, "We have refined our approach so that any external campaign we involve ourselves in maintains direct connection with the evolution of our life as a living group, the heart of the Can Masdeu Project. (66)  Overall, the project generated a community garden that had a waitlist for parcels, and encouraged more efficient energy and green solutions to be utilized.  This is a constant work in progress, but overall the project brought a lot of media attention, which helped to change the public perception and put the project in a positive light.  Public perception, to me, is everything, it can either kill you or lift you up.  When the project's life expectancy was in question, the media attention it received was going to enable them to start and initiate new projects with more support, fortunately, Project Can Masdeu continues today.
