<h1>Framing Landscape</h1>

	<p>
	The Right to Landscape: An Introduction, by Shelly Egoz, Jala Makeshzoumi, and Gloria Pungetti, discusses the importance of framing landscape in new and innovative ways to bring about true social justice.  The concept of human rights is introduced as one that forms a link between itself and landscape, and therefore the right to landscape should be continuously explored.  Everybody has the right to a healthy environment and legacies of heritage, but what does that mean?

<h1>Defining Landscape</h1>

	<p>
	Landscape, in general, is noted here as "hard to define" due to the many differential factors constantly circulating around it.  There are tangible and intangible dimensions at play.  The tangible being the need for survival; the resources the land offers up.  The intangible being the spiritual, emotional, and psychological factors.  This reading truly is an introduction, as all of these conversations and ideas presented lead to rather open ended discussion; no definitive solution is presented, just the idea that landscape needs to be viewed more indepthly.  No landscape is the same and therefore, it may be difficult or even impossible to assign some universal notion regarding landscape, but the desire to be more inclusive and understanding still resonates.

<h1>Personal Takeaways</h1>

	<p>
	My favorite discussion piece and take away from this reading was the notion of using landscape and ecology as the pre existing infrastructure system; the idea that the land dictates its potential.  This is something that I personally believe is garnering traction among more and more people.  Trying to work within the constraints of the land, and not against, and retain as much of the landscape as possible is a growing trend.  This can be accelerated through increased levels and efforts of education and understanding of the different types of landscapes.
