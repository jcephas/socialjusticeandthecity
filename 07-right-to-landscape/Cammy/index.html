    	<p>Cordingley discusses the autonomous squatted community outside of Barcelona inhabited by squatters, activists, and environmentalists, which has successfully endured and thrived to this day as an expression of anarchy.  In “The Right to Landscape: An Introduction,” the authors introduce discourse that directly connects landscape and human rights with a layered and dynamic discussion of landscape as a fluctuating social, cultural, and physical conception. </p>
    	<p>The discussion of the right to landscape suggests possibilities of new models for the practice, particularly, of landscape architecture.  It considers and suggests the breadth of which landscape, and thus, the field of landscape architecture may be imagined.  By embracing the truly interdisciplinary and all-encompassing possibilities, practitioners can all begin to envision endless possibilities.   To prevent landscape architecture from being trapped by professionalized technicalities and territoriality, we must pool together our knowledge and experiences of landscape architecture, ecology, geology, history, sociology, activism, and more to address the “landscape.”</p>
    	<p>Both readings embrace the potential of the landscape in advancing human life and human rights to life.  At their cores, these ideas are anarchist.  Cordingley writes, <p1> “In Can Masdeu exists anarchy so pure, so fluid and so strong, that some cannot even see it.” </p1>  These ideas of the landscape are so simple that describing them as anarchist almost feels theatrical.  Yet, in our current ideological space, truly too many obstacles prevent our ability to simply aid and support one another.  Only by approaching our work with the mindset of mutual aid and the landscape as a neighborhood commons can we hope to, not just build together, but grow together.  We can look to the mycorrhizal networks spread across the surface of the earth, communicating and thriving below our feet, feeding into a symbiotic network, as we take up their ancient and enduring practice for the livelihood of all of our landscapes. </p>
