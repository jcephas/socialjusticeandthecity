		<h1>CAN MASDEAU<h1>
			<p>The squatting of Can Masdeu is an expression and physical representation of the discourse brought fourth in The right to Landscape. The Okupas, through utilizing a squatting approach were able to prevent and bring awareness to the improper use of land that is resulting to a combined poor management of land. On a larger scale each individual action accumulates to a larger problem, of diminishing landscapes with each parcel holding great value socially and ecologically. Human rights in this circumstance protected the okupas from being forced out of a property in which they were not the owners. The owners acted legally in attempts to evict the squatters but had failed to do so after active protest and demonstration. The bold actions taken by the Okupas gained national attention due to there unwillingness to leave the property due which lends itself to who has the right to this landscape. This right to landscape is given to individuals, communities, nations, economically disadvantaged, indigenous, and marginalized. The owner of the Can Masdeu for unclear purposes but likely waiting for market rates to rise or for capitalist reasons, held this derelict property harming preventing others from this right. The okupas exposed this harsh reality and highlighted on an single case basis that the right to a landscape can be viewed as a collective instead of an individual one. </p>
