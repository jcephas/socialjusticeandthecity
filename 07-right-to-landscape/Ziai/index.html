			<p id="one" > The two articles talked about how human rights relate to the landscape. By stating the concept, the right to landscape is the framing of landscape as more than a material object of an objective environment. And the landscape can be seen as a relationship between humans and their surroundings. As well, the article “Right to Landscape” stated that rights specific to environmental protection are recognized human rights related to threats to human health and the basic right of existence. The writer noted that human rights and landscape are connected with multi-aspects. What’s more, when we need to address the landscape issue, people need to consider other aspects of knowledge, such as sociology, geology, etc.</p>


			<p id="one"> Besides, these two articles there also stated that humans and landscape are mutually reinforcing. Also, the way we define the landscape may change with the development of society. After reading these two articles, one thing that can connect with previous readings is the designer, and the architects need to understand the need and then start to design genuinely. If the designer and the architects rely on their knowledge and ideas, without considering the actual situation will not work.
