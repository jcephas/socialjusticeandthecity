		<h1>PRUIT IGO</h1>


		<p>“Pruit Igo would be here today if they had maintained it when they opened it up” says a resident of Pruit Igo in 1954, the year of its opening. In an effort to condemn slum housing, the 1949 housing act enabled the city of St. Louis to build public housing, a modernist approach to solve a growing problem. The post war project for urban renewal was meant to symbolize a rebirth to the city, but its multiple failures only added to the problems. The failures not only stemmed from the current maintenance issues but it resembled a larger issue, intertwined in a history of neglect and bureaucratic decision making desperate for revitalizing a city in decline. Clearing slums to build towers for redevelopment was the priority, but the lack of proper planning on federal funding for maintenance provided a clear trajectory towards disaster

		<h1></h1>
		<p>The growth of suburbia contributed vastly to the decline in population growth in St. Louis and around the country. The popularity of propaganda of owning lots of land to establish an American Dream vision appealed to the majority of white middle class and therefore fleed the city in search of this new vision. Without adding the growth of suburbia into the equation would create a formula with a missing variable unable to solve. To follow would be a vast sprawl and new problem not only ecologically but socially.  The social problem shifted from slums that were a result of segregation, to maintaining cities and jobs. As cities lost middle class and jobs, the downtown area’s suffered. The combination of an abandoning city center and the birth of Pruit Igo created a catastrophic ending, with its eventual tear down. While residents were happy at first and optimistic, it was clear from the early birth of this new housing, was a way to contain slums and with a rising vacancy rate the rent money meant to cover maintenance would fail to keep up with costs. <BR>
			<BR>
			While Pruit Igo resembles the failures of public housing, there was much to learn from this. Giving residents adequate opportunity, amenities, and proper funding mechanisms are the clear take ways. The deeper solution begins with recognizing the vast network of systematic tactics that have historically and presently prevent equal access to opportunity.
