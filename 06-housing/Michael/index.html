<h1>Who's to blame?</h1>

	<p>
	The Pruitt-Igoe Housing Project was conceived with good intentions, but somewhere along the way, the hopes and goals of the project were lost, leaving the residents in dismay.  Many were blamed for the failure of Pruitt-Igoe, building planners/developers, architects, big government, residents, etc. but understanding the situation and the particular standards of this particular area are of vital importance and conducive in ensuring better future projects.  
	</p>

	<a href="#section02">Perceived Future</a>

</div>

<div id="section02" class="second">

<h1>Perceived Future</h1>

	<p>
	The future of St. Louis, Missouri, was believed to be bright in the early 1950s.  It was believed that the city was going to double in population size over the coming years, which led to developers pushing for large building complexes to house these residents and migrants; shift toward modern architecture.  For a while the project was a success.  Maintenance and upkeep kept the community alive, but as trends started to shift and the city began to change, so did the maintenance.  With "white flight" people began to leave the city in exchange for new suburban areas, which allowed for properly planned buildings, with yards, better schools, infrastructure systems, etc., but most importantly it offered people and towns independence.  This was made possible by the 1949 Housing Act, which expanded FHA loans, making it less expensive to buy a new suburban home than rent in the city.  People were taking advantage of what was put before them, leaving others in their wake.  
	</p>

	<p>
	With people leaving the inner city, rental opportunities soared and the residents of Pruitt-Igoe began to leave the Housing Project in favor of non-housing authority housing, which left vacancies diminishing the overall rent intake.  This meant that the project could no longer sustain itself and pay for the quality care levels that were previously given and administered.  At one given point in time 12,000+ residents were housed at Pruitt-Igoe, that number diminished to less than 2,500.  Now buildings were left abandoned and uncared for.  Crime and fear became synonymous with Pruitt-Igoe, and in a way, unjustifiably so.  The crime and fear were coming from the outside in.  
	</p>

<a href="#section03">The Shortcomings</a>

</div>


<div id="section03" class="third">
	<h1>The Shortcomings</h1>
	<p>
	The failure, to me, can be attributed to the change and shift in trends that the city and planners foresaw coming.  The residents were put into a situation that they could never survive or sustain themselves longterm given the implications and standards attributed to them, but this was nobody's intention.  St. Louis' economy and population were on a downward spiral, no public housing project would have been able to survive.  
	</p>

	<p>
	The demolition of Pruitt-Igoe, which in its first phase, was nationally broadcasted, was seen as the city acknowledging the Pruitt-Igoe Housing Project, publicly, as a failure.  This failure resulted in many of the residents having stifled opportunities in life going forward.  This case in particular is sad and disheartening, as the intention and good will seemed to be present, and this was echoed by previous residents in the Pruitt-Igoe Myth.  That housing development was home, and for many, people's first apartment, with their own bedroom, and clean water and facilities, memories and bonds grew there that continue to live on.  It is imperative that we all work together to understand one another, and help each other, and foresee future problems.  We must continue to stay and get involved within our communities, and have faith in our justice systems, always working to refine and improve upon what we have built on throughout the decades.
