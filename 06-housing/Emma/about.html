    <h1>About</h1>

    <body>
        <p id="intro">This website was developed as a final project for ARCH 6340: Social Justice & the City - Race, Space & Ethics in Architecture & Urbanism. A series of ineractive components are implemented in order to explore the relationship between the body, race and, identity. In particular, how they are influenced by landscape and architecture as these entities are the foremost characteristics in which we engage our environments. These traits also hold gravity in the ways in which others and society can exploits us. Although informative, this website also intends to engage the user in considering their own persona and identity in relation to the spaces in which they take up and find comfort, or maybe even discomfort in. Based on an synthesis of the course material the author, Emma Palacio, offers speculations for new methods in education and architectural practice that diminish the gap between architecture and community development.</p>

        <p id="about">Emma Palacio is currently a candidate for a Master's degree in architecture at Northeastern University.</p>
