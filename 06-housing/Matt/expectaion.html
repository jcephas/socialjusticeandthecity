				<p>The love and admiration that the former residents of Pruitt-Igoe speak of their community with, when juxtaposed next to the media-proliferated images of violence and destruction, immediately bring to mind our discussion from earlier in the semester regarding the difference between The Black Belt and Bronzeville. When the buildings were initially opened, resident’s needs were generally being met. In this case, the top-down planning goal of “liberating [people] from the slums” was successful. Former residents spoke of the initial pride and care they had for the new community. For as long as maintenance was allowed to continue, the intersections between local use and external goals remained harmonious.  This was the expectation for the life of the project, one that was realized at the beginning. But what was the reality, and what does that tell us about the attitudes of those that held the fate of the residents of Pruitt-Igoe in their hands?</p>
