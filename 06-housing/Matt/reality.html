				<p>In Nature and Space, Scott’s example of the development of forestry noted a curious phenomena of “missing the forest for the trees” as a critical downfall of top-down planning schemes. It is arguable that this is what occurred at Pruitt-Igoe. The American bureaucratic system is incredibly vulnerable to special interest groups with ulterior motivations impacting the lives of those that do not have the same access to resources to create competing groups. Banks, real estate firms, and developers lobbied to unite financial and racial motivations in limiting the amount of funding public housing projects had for maintenance, essentially tying their success to being fully rented. All of these represent a complex landscape of competing organizations operating at the local, state, and federal level. </p>

				<p>At the same time, racial tension around the slow desegregation of American society led to the population that would ensure these buildings would never have the rent-base to accommodate the long-term care of the structures. In this way, competing and multivariate interests conspired to ensure that the Pruitt-Igoe project would never be successful. In this way, the project serves as another example of the simple, top-down solution by the state failing. The problem of dilapidated, dangerous housing for the poor was answered by the solution of simply condensing people in “better” accommodations. If planners had actually studied conditions on the ground and learned what prospective residents actually needed, the fate of Pruitt-Igoe may have been avoided, and the outcome may have been closer to the expectation.</p>
