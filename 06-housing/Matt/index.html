				<p> As we have seen time and time again across many examples, the right to access fair and equitable housing is at the center of many discussions around race and space in the American city. Racially segregated portions of cities were callously allowed to fall into disrepair, creating the image of “blight” that would later be exploited by developers as an alibi to reclaim and reap the value of land in urban centers. The material this week, which consists of the 2012 film <i>The Pruitt-Igoe Myth</i>, examines on a specific level what became of the people that live in these areas when the top-down mechanism of governmental planning deems their living conditions as untenable. </p>

				<p>In the film, there is a noticeable tension between the expectations of public housing projects such as Pruitt-Igoe, and the reality of the execution and lived experience of them. This tension is not equal, it is experienced and perceived differently through real experience and media proliferation for both those that lived in the complex and those that did not. In either case, I believe that much of the course of events that transpired in St. Louis represent further examples of top-down governmental planning disregarding the lived experiences of people in favor of an efficient bureaucracy. </p>
