					String b = "I think one of the most paradoxical statements I found in the Calhoun reading was Benjamin Disraeli’s notion that “many workers would vote conservative if they were given more to defend,” as this really highlights whose burden of responsibility it is for workers to possess something worth defending. From the progressive point of view, the responsibility lies on the state, as services such as healthcare and housing provided by the state and through their public ownership, would provide workers with something worth defending. Alternatively, a supporter of capitalism might argue that thing worth defending would be their freedom, independence, or even believe that the free market pays workers fairly, and their earned dollars are enough to pay for their healthcare and housing.";

					String c = "Another point Calhoun makes is that corporate capitalism has “fundamentally altered capitalism from the classical image (and self-regulating operations) that Adam Smith envisaged.” This does a good job of helping articulate one of the reasons that the “social movement” came about, as it could be a reaction to the formation of corporations in exploiting classical capitalism such that it disenfranchises those who were meant to be benefit from the system.";
