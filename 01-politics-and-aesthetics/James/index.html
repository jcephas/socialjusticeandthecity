  String a = "In both Ranciere and Calhoun’s readings, they somehow pointed out a complicated relation between social movement and aesthetical designs. People’s minds are evolving throughout the times with incidents happened, and we are taking shifts in the ways which we receive and observe our surroundings. In some cases, there are racial elements involved within these changes as one of the statements in Calhoun’s book pointed out that “…perhaps only white, male property holders, perhaps all citizens.” (62, Calhoun) The injustice buried within our social ideologies enable some of the most unconscious differences around people’s lives, such as individual living spaces or group communities. 
  In Calhoun’s reading, he pointed out that a movement is something established within shared identity and interests among participants, which I totally comprehended by seeing all the protests have occurred after various racial or political incidents. The power of the affinities showed the strength of accumulated population occupying a designated area of space, which leads me thinking over the purpose of designing for certain public spaces were never intended to accommodate such social activities. 
  Back to the readings’ topics that I think the social movement itself is a powerful way to reflect lots of the social obstacles and difficulties we encountered every day, but in a more dramatic and radical way of expressing the needs for changing. Many of the social injustice were carrying over from past to nowadays, and some of them can be eased or even ceased over times shortly, but some of the racial and stereotypical ones are not fading away easily, which makes me wonder what architects or planners can do in terms of supporting such social movements being occurred within various spaces and built environments.";
