# politics-and-aesthetics_Phillip
 
In contemporary discourse and practice, architecture has typically rendered aesthetics and politics as mutually incompatible ideations of the world, preferring instead to frame the world through the lens of either one or the other, but rarely both at the same time. First, we will clarify what exactly is meant by ‘politics’ and what is meant by ‘aesthetics’. Then, we will consider politics and aesthetics as inextricably bound and ponder what it means to approach the world with this framing.
