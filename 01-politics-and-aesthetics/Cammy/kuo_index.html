			String s = "   To suggest that the idea of progress is a mirage of the times as societal realities continually shift, Calhoun unravels the history and construction of “the social movement” throughout the ages and across different civilizations.  Similarly, Ranciere reveals the link between politics and aesthetics by analyzing their dichotomy of the visible and invisible, and the possible and impossible, proposing undoing conceptions of artistic production to contribute to a more democratic politics and aesthetics.  This discussion on the idea of social movements correlates with Mannheim’s.  “Social movements” take the form of a utopianism, driven by discontent with the status quo ideology.  Yet, once the previous utopianism is usurped, the idea of progress is institutionalized and reset.  In this way, the liberal grows into the conservative; radical becomes routine.  The contradiction of good versus bad can never be as society exists with the continual production of ideologies.  With globalization and foreign policy becoming more significant than ever, interpretations of social movements beyond our localities are increasingly built on precarious constructions.  The eagerness to participate and fight on this global platform for “liberty” and “freedom” requires the assumption of another’s conception of “justice.”  Regardless of what point politically, economically, and socially societies may exist at, a desire for change will always rise.  Progress will never be linear without a biased ideology to uphold it.  As noted, radical action comes from a significantly different place than moderate action. Current ideological constructions seek to establish themselves with permanence in our minds to obscure truly how recent and firm they may be.  This idea of permanence tests our imagination in visualizing what is and what could be, likewise in aesthetics.  Simply, the most significant obstacle is a lack of imagination.  ";
