	<p>	"In these readings Calhoun in, Social Movements and The Idea of Progress", breaks down how we have shifted from what was considered to be a "movement" to a "social movement". Groups came together to focus on a set of goals, with a main idea set in place to emerge from, and these ideas came for various reasons: necessary change, neglected groups, majority versus minority, etc.  </p>

	<p>However within this reading for me the quote which stuck out most was, " we gain insight into how the conventional understandings of socialist, liberal, and conservative politics were invented and how they sometimes mislead us." (Calhoun- 46). I think that, especially in today's time of politics, this makes a lot of sense, when you stop and just try to break things down, political parties are essentially large social movement groups with elected leaders to push the agenda of said party.  Within these groups we have seen as Calhoun puts it "Spheres" of groups, which formed to push specific concerns of groups further, such as labor unions, school and support systems, which may have swayed the support or agenda of specific parties.  However, these groups have become so deadlocked, in my opinion, with each other that the call for a new political party, or "social movement" is garnering support.  It has gone too far past the point of return, where specifics groups are being alienated by one another, but this seems to play into history, as we have seen this happen before.</p>


	<p>Ranciere in the Distribution of the Sensible, discusses how figures play their role in politics.  The notion of the greater good is brought about.  We have the masses versus everyone else (minority).</p>  
	
	<p>This idea, when actually sitting down and thinking about it, may not be the most effective or fair way to go about in a society of many. Yes, in theory, majority wins, but for some the majority is not a possibility when we refer to race or ethnicities (at least for foreseeable future).  Groups whose political wants and needs will be neglected merely because of lack of size or support.  When we think this way, we are, in a way thinking statically, rather than dynamically.  There needs to be a way for justice to be had for all, where all groups are heard, regardless of size."</p>
