    <h1>The Right to the City</h1>

    <body>
    <div>

        <h3>Introduction</h3>

        <p id="intro">In “Writings on Cities”, Lefebvre discusses the many aspects in which cities are perceived and engaged with in respect to the human conditions and desires, while the “City Repair Project” provides a case study example on how Seattle has begun to bridge the gap between architecture and its people. </p>

            <h3>Analysis</h3>

            <p>Similarly to “The Right to Landscape”, Lefebvre also cites the link between the right to the city and freedom of expression as certain spaces can hinder or facilitate these instances. Another similarity between these two physical entities is their temporal aspects since they both can be subjected to a particular time or place. However, one interesting distinction between cities and landscapes is the idea that since architecture is an abstraction of concepts, it only represents a partial truth. Lefebvre states, “given that these architects form a social body, they attach themselves to institutions, their system tends to close itself off, impose itself and elude all criticism.” [1]. Here we can see how personal implications can begin to influence aesthetic or systematic design choices that can lead to larger social and political conflicts.</p>

            <p>The main concept that I took away from this reading is that architecture should be about using its tools and methodologies in conjunction with understanding the human condition in order to achieve freedom. As lefebvre states, only those who are exploited truly understand these systematic struggles can create change within communities. This idea is further supported by the successes that are described by Cowan, Lakeman, Leis, Lerch, and Semenza. Their chapter asserts that architecture should be built by the people for the people. In extension to these rights to the city it is also critical for architectural knowledge to be public and accessible.</p>
