					<p>One issue regarding many cities are questions of inequity. Because the layout and construction of cities are done on such a large scale, most of the organization of cities is directed by those who have accumulate the most power in the general vicinity, resulting in cities that are designed in favor of those who hold said power. Because most of the cities that are currently inhabited in the United States were designed and constructed prior to our lifetimes, it has become increasingly difficult to change the physical landscape to create more just spaces.</p>

					<p>One way that individuals combat this is through guerilla activism. Instead of relying on existing structures and networks that were built without the residents in mind, activists can sidestep the bureucratic structures of urban planners and construct their own spaces. Whether it be the usage of tents or kiosks, communities can work for themselves to provide the services that planners failed to factor in for them.</p>

					<p>While these activists do aid in reconciling inequity in urban spaces, more can always be done. Food deserts exist throughout many cities, and environmental racism has taken advantage of inequity in urban spaces to prey on those who have the fewest safety nets. Making use of abandoned buildings, setting up permanent markets, and establishing pop-up clinics where they are most needed can help to alleviate issues caused by negligent or deliberately predatory planning. When local governments act against the interest of their residents, acting and working in a community's self interest is a way to alleviate the wounds caused by such infractions of trust.</p>
