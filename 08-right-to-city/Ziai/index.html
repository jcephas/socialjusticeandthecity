			<p class="new"> The right to the city is like a cry and a demand. This right slowly meanders through the surprising detours of nostalgia and tourism, the return to the heart of the traditional city, and the call of existent or recently developed centralities. The claim to nature, and the desire to enjoy it displace the right to the city. </p>

		<div id="section03" class="third">

			<p id="one" > In the article “The Right to the City,” the writer Henri Lefebvre stated that the right to the city is like a cry and a demand. In Lefebvre’s opinion, the right to the city cannot be conceived of as a simple visiting right or as a return to traditional cities. It can only be formulated as a transformed and renewed right to urban life. The designers and the architects are not the people who can decide the city’s formative. The people who can decide the city’s formative is the neighbors who lives in that area. Just like the idea of “The City Repair Project” stated, the creation of a place whose structure and use is determined by the people who inhabit that place. </p>


			<p id="one"> The City Repair’s work is based on the idea of placemaking. I think this is more about people-based idea. And this is a way to connect individuals to plan and implement creative and attractive urban places that enrich their quality of life. The two readings also bring me back to the movie of The Puritt-Igoe Myth. The gap between the architects and the residents made the environment of the community became increasingly uninhabitable. However, the city repair project promotes events and activities that inspire people to take active, direct roles in re-creating their neighborhoods and cities.
