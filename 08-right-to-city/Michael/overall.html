	<h1>Conclusion</h1>

	<p>



Overall these actions, levels of understanding, between neighbors and strangers, and successes, both minor and major, have proven to have positive impacts on a community; it has brought life into a community.  The City Repair Project and its involvement in the taking back of intersections as gathering spaces has proven that when a community gets involved with one another, and the levels of power and responsibilities are spread out amongst many different groups of people, our communication is enhanced, as different people have different approaches and interests; this is where strong team building and relationships occur.  However, unlike Lefebvre, I believe that there is more than one way to achieve and satisfy the needs of the "urban", and his rhetoric, of what I am taking it as, of cancel culture does more harm than good.
