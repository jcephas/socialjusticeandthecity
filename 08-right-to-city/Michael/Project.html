	<h1>The City Repair Project</h1>

	<p>


The City Repair Project, which is based in Portland Oregon, has become a precedent study for the development and beginning of new projects throughout various communities and neighborhoods across the nation.  Knowledge has been the forefront of success for these future generations.  Community has also become a focal point here.  Through the process of actions that are geared toward educating and involving the locals within their community, they have achieved improved levels of social networks and overall well-being.  They have even noted that there has been a decreased level of reported crimes, all through the, "merits of public participation in urban design with cost-effective benefits to the community" (Cowan, et al. 17)
