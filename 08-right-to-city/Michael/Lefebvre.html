Lefebvre was a French Marxist Philosopher, who wrote this piece over the course of 20 years.  In this reading Lefebvre describes individual needs, social needs, special needs, and the needs of the city and urban life, as if the city were to be a living organism.  He includes hyperbole after hyperbole to illustrate his points, "What the eyes and analysis perceive on the ground can at best pass for the shadow of a future object in the light of a rising sun." (Lefebvre - 148).  Many of his theories seem to fall in line with the ideas of anti-capitalist, "exchange value, commerce, profit",; communism.  The idea he puts forth, to me, relates back to current times of cancel culture; he has a bleak outlook of old or classical humanism.  "The career of the old classical humanism ended long ago and badly.  It is dead.  Its mummified and embalmed corpse weighs heavily and does not smell good... this old humanism died during the World Wars, during the demographic growth." (Lefebvre - 149)  It seems as those he is advocating that the urban needs can only be satisfied through socialist means.  However, I would argue that capitalist endeavors can have virtuous ends.  Why can we not fulfill these needs without tearing down old humanism?  Public spaces have and continue to be employed through individuals and individual donations, i.e Rockefeller Center.  Lefebvre makes a lot of assumptions in this reading, and I am not sure they are all true.  "One only has to open one's eyes to understand the daily life of the one who runs from his dwelling to the station... to return the same way in the evening and come home to recuperate enough to start again the next day.  The picture of this generalized misery..." (Lefebvre - 159).  Could this not be the choice of the individual, instead of presumed misery?
