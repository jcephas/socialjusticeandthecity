		<h1>THE RIGHT TO THE CITY<h1>
			<p>“Only groups, social classes and class fractions capable of revolutionary initiative can take over and realize to fruition solutions to urban problems. It is from these social and political forces that the renewed city will become the oeuvre.” Henri Lefebvre speaks on the problems with the existing city speaking on it in terms of an outdated agrarian city that must be transformed from one of hierarchal decision making that has promoted segregation and despair in many forms. The urban form and actions within a city struggling with its definition still lend opportunity to a utopian future that as Lefebvre says “who is not a utopian today”? Through the propositions of “political programme of Urban reform” and “mature planning projects” as Lefebvre states, the existing city and urban typologies can begin to mold without following any feasible standard. The City Repair Project is one example of how the city can begin this remolding by utilizing space was referred to as “not a public space”. Through this lens the intersection design which eventually caught traction with communities was first restricted by the town which one may classify as unfeasible. Through social and urban reform which “questions the structure, the immediate (individual) and daily relations of existing society” (Lefebvre, 154) a new conception, use of space can be imagined even with opposition. It is through these social movements that change begins and the city is formed. Much like the opposition faced in Can Masdeau, the intersection was viewed at first as out of the ordinary. What is the meaning of activating this space? The study of anthropology showed humans need for space. When space and amenities are lacking, typically imposed through planning measures, like seen in the failures of Pruit Igo, the residents absorb the burden. It is in these voids, which in the instance of the city repair project in Portland, that space can lesson the burden communities absorb and begin to create interaction, community, and new thinking for more active spaces. This placemaking allows the people who inhabit the space to determine identity, meaning, and culture.  </p>
