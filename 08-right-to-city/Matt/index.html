					<p>The two readings for this class period discussed the right to access the city, to access centers of urban activity that represent the places in our world in which culture and community are disseminated between people. In his article, Henri Lefebvre discusses the value of the right to access these urban centers regularly, by discussing the basic human need to gather experience, release energy, and to percieve the lives of others as well as be percieved. He also questions the involvement in the determination of urban space by questioning <i>"what is important? Who thinks? Who acts? Who still speaks and for whom?"</i>. This notion of representation, of speaking for others, becomes all the more important when considering the companion piece for this section, a discussion of the City Repair movement in Portland, Oregon in the early 2000's. The movement was very similar to much of the insurrectionist urbanism that we have discussed thusfar in class, most notably in their first foray in reclaiming public space for a specific community being very similar to ARCH's occupation of the 125th street site in Harlem. Something that is ambiguous, however, is who is counted as a memeber of the local community and who is excluded?</p>

					<p> Lefebvre insits that the participation of the working class in the only manner in which radical insurrectionist urban change can occur. We are living in a moment of intense gentrification of American cities, in which working class people (primarily working class people of color) are being "priced out" and made to leave their homes. The work of City Repair is essential, as it integrates memebers of a specific "village" within a city by sending out a spark, similar to the local-focused approaches of organizations like ARCH or the Rural Studio. They recognize, like Lefebrve says, that the planner cannot materialize a social environment, the city is naturally constructed over time by the people that live there. The question that remains is one of legibility and access. If only the wealthy are allowed to remain living in the city, will only their voices be represented in grassroots organiztions such as these? Will these organizations even exist if only the wealthy live in cities? I believe this underscores the suprememe need for affordable housing in cities, to ensure that ad hoc grass roots organiztions such as ARCH or City Repair or even the occupation of Can Masdeau can occur, for utopian alternatives to continue to be experimented upon in the city. </p>
