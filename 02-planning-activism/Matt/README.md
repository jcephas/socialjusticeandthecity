Architects, landscape architects, urban planners, and other built environment professionals are responsible for shaping cities in favor of the health, safety, and welfare of urban residents. What ethical issues arise when the work of these professionals don’t work in the favor of the health, safety, and welfare of urban residents? How have ordinary residents attempted to remake their neighborhoods and cities on their own?
