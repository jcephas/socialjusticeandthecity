Reflecting from prior readings, the misconceptions and injustice planted deep down within the beneficial white middle-class and governments caused countless biased scenarios from home mortgages to racial labeled communities among various colored groups throughout decades.";

The branching of the I-95 stayed as a victorious result of a series of social movements that occurred through decades from the 1950s, which stood as one of the successful examples of confronting the municipal authorities on reshaping the urban landscapes and communities.

The subsequential impacts were huge: …the human need for vibrant, socially connected neighborhoods could not have been more antithetical to midcentury American urban planning norms. (Crockett 11)   The people of Puerto Rico in New York also had a valuable case in terms of grouping people together to devote the rights to their communities – The activists were drawn from diverse backgrounds: students, ex-gang members, ex-convicts, addicts and other street people. (Gandy 164).";

The I-95 would possibly get built if Brookline or any other involved city did not join with the movement nor persist long enough time to uphold their voices, but these different neighborhoods took their stands regardlessly.  The lessons were valuable – people with unfair treats or damaged interests need to advocate their rights together even when they may be powerless from the first place, but the payback will return eventually.";
