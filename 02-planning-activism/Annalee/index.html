<p>In “Between Borinquen and the Barrio” by Matthew Gandy and “People Before Highways” by Karilyn Crockett, the authors show that <b>grassroots activism</b> has challenged the assertive urban planning policies pursued by political actors with their economic interests as primary drivers.  Such movements have stemmed from <b>disruptive demolitions for urban renewal projects and highway expansions</b>, as well as <b>racialized and institutionalized unequal treatment</b> which has <b>threatened the health and wellbeing</b> of subjected populations.  While Crockett discusses arising social movements distantly, Gandy focuses on the roots and progress of the Young Lords, who gained momentum as Puerto Ricans in New York City faced abhorrent conditions, especially with the <i>garbage offensive</i> and <b>brutal violence</b> applied by law enforcement. Central to the themes of both pieces is the idea of <b>self-determination</b>: while centralized political actors relegate and constrain populations, they teeter on the edge of their democratic legitimacy.  Progressives who have recognized this, in conjunction with the inequities they have faced, oppose these measures taken by the government and urban planners.</p>
<p>Crockett recounts the discord between residents and political actors in postwar urban planning.  With highway expansion projects and modernist urban renewal policies, there grew civil unrest among progressives and the displaced, who contended that decisions about land use and division should be more democratic. As a result of these highway expansion projects which cut through-- rather than

    <p>around-- cities, <b>diverse urban communities were disrupted</b>. Critics of the existing urban planning practices and policies included Jacqueline Leavitt and Jane Jacobs, who saw urban environments as <b>“vehicles for self-governance” </b>(Jacobs), where <b>socially connected environments</b> would make a healthier urbanity than sought uncreative planners. Presenting examples of this imbalance in cities across the United States, Crockett shows how, even where federal courts may sympathize with residents’ concerns about the destruction and division of federal highway expansion in their areas, local authorities underwrote these decisions by building roads despite those judicial orders. </p>
<p>Examining the case of the Boston-Cambridge area, Crockett notes that in the late 1960s, political activist groups like the Urban Planning Aid, the Black United Front, and the Greater Boston Committee <b>demanded a more democratic urban development agenda</b>.  They took notice of how the organization of the area was driven largely by private investors’ interests and overtook the interests of longtime residents, whose lack of mobility and access to housing left them constrained by the impending urban renewal pursuits.  Notably, various demolition projects and highway expansions cut through areas occupied by communities whose predominant demographics were simultaneously targeted by exclusive immigration policies, such as with the case of Boston’s “Chinatown.” Moreover, Crockett unfolds that matters of transportation, from its infrastructure to its service, have been central to the development of Civil Rights.  Especially in Boston, the dissipation of communities due to urban clearance has given rise to grassroots movements through which the public acts to <b><i>take urban planning into their own hands.</i></b> </p>
<p><b>To begin to evaluate the strength with which grassroots movements have helped shape urban planning measures, this visualization examines urban renewal plans in the City of Boston. Upon a closer look, it can be said that some areas have received more industrial-related spatial designations; others have received institutional focus; there have also been concentrations of new green space, new residences, and commercial development.  We may ask, what drove the decisions to designate each of these land uses, and to what extent have progressive activists influenced the decisions?  When such activists successfully influence the decisions made, do their realizations promote desegregation?  Ultimately, we may use this information to understand, in a given context, what kinds of urban planning schema are viable for fostering equity.</b></p>
<p><b>Recent infrastructural developments like the Big Dig, along with other Urban Renewal projects in recent decades, have changed major parts of Boston’s core.  The map above shows how urban renewal projects (such as those presented by the Boston Planning & Development Agency) have taken form throughout Boston in recent decades. The addition of an analytical map presented by WBUR, detailing the % change of resident populations by race in Boston areas, that the areas along Huntington Avenue (Back Bay and the South End, namely) have seen increases in populations of white dwellers, while adjacent, industrial areas have seen increases in populations of non-white dwellers. </b></p>
