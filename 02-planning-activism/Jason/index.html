			What both Gandy and Crockett are identifying in their writings is the mismanagement of public funds that results in detrimental effects for our country’s most vulnerable people. The Young Lords fought to address the neglect of their community, attempting to address the inequitable infant mortality rates and waste management policies that resulted in poor living conditions and a sense of poverty in an otherwise wealthy country. Boston’s antihighway activists conversely fought for money to not be spent in such a way that would result in the destruction of homes and communities. Both are demonstrations of how public services and public works are skewed to benefit individuals who are in power while further suppressing those who would suffer due to their side-effects or the ruling class’s negligence of those below them.

They grew into a full-fledged political entity which would then go on to advocate for better services provided to the Nuyorican population, advocating for equal rights for a population of Americans that had been consistently disenfranchised by the existing system of power.";

These activists came together to vehemently oppose the construction of public works projects that would inadvertently result in the destruction of neighborhoods and further divide the city.";
