			Both of these readings describe the impacts of local organizational groups that target social injustices.  Localized groups, based on the readings, seem to garner more support from the surrounding public and/or targeted ethnic groups, which provides a seeable change.  The problem with an activist group garnering too much support can lead a group astray in their mission or goals previously set out; the people get out ranked.

			Crockett's reading discusses the importance of transportation, specifically in Boston.  The issue of transportation is one that all people face, so it becomes a good point to garner support around as you look to improve the overall status of your group.  People, as they should, believe that they should have a say and right to dictate their future build environment, if they do not have this option, the whole notion of democracy is at stake.  The building of highways had many perceived negative effects on the people of the surrounding area, such as housing displacement, and overall access to parts of the city.  Their concerns were met with the idea that modernism equates to a better future, but is that necessarily true?  The city planners were dominated by white male workers who now largely lived in the surrounding suburban areas, which meant that the "modernism" taking place was going to be making their lives better, for the price of others.  The activist groups and anti-highwaymen of Boston, highlighted these people's concerns and brought more of the public into the decision making.  "These lessons in conjunction with residents ongoing urban renewal battles birthed a radical grassroots political agenda intolerant of government-led efforts to reorder urban space through exclusionary, abusive, and antidemocratic means." (15 - Crockett)

			Gandy's reading was slightly different, and focused on the Puerto Rican activist group, Young Lords.  This group started small, and aligned themselves with other, smaller, activist groups within New York to get their message heard, as only minimal amounts of Puerto Rican's were in the area at the time of operation.  Social injustices lead to revolt and/or protest, and in this case uncollected garbage became the focal point of concern.  Uncollected garbage highlighted a group's indignity of poverty, political invisibility, and flat out municipal neglect; people want to be seen and heard.  As more Puerto Rican's migrated to the area, and the group started to be more involved with radio, newspapers, high profile people, poetry, and other activities, the group became stronger.  This is an example of an activist group garnering too much power to the point where they lost site of their original vision.  Violence ensued within the group along with a toss of power, and this ultimately led the public to alienate themselves, and align with other groups; there were too many negative connotations surrounding the Young Lords, potentially to the point of hypocrisy.

		<p class="bodyText">Overall, activist groups come about when groups are tired of being unheard and unseen.  You can only have faith and follow the rules for so long before you must take drastic actions.
