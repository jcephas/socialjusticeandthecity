  					String s = "This weeks readings demonstrated the impact that public organization can have on larger groups in power. The author Karilyn Crockett is introducing a local example of the influence of the organization of citizens can have over large scale urban planning in the Introduction of People Before Highways. In the reading Between Borinquen and the Barrio, the author Matthew Gandy is using the organization of the Young Lords as an example of the intersection between environmental politics and social justice. A commonality between the two readings I think was the highlighted importance of design and planning for the citizens and current residents rather than an idealized population density and identity. Additionally, when planning and design do not consider the needs and wants of communities who inhabit urban spaces, Crockett and Gandy provide examples of citizen organization that both succeeded and failed in the act of preserving their communities.";

Specifically with the reading by Gandy, a strong sense of community was formed around a common goal for social justice. I think it is really important to have advocacy for communities, but these advocacy organizations should not be oppressed as the Young Lords and similar groups were. City planners and architects should take steps to communicate with these advocates to protect and improve upon communities in which are already established, rather than citizens having to fight against more powerful politicians and planners.";
