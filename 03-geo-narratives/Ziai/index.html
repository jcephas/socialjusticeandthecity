	<p id="one" > Scott argued that the most tragic episodes of state-initiated social engineering originate in a pernicious combination of  the four elements. In the chapter of “Nature and Space,” Scott began with the story of scientific forestry in Germany in the eighteenth century. He stated the unsuccessful idea of planned forestry spread to the worldwide and the result was devastating. As well as Scott described how the government control the forest and the society at that time. However, planning and measurement became a desirable activity in some countries. As the states were focusing on tax collection, they ignored the land and its people. The tax collection was based on the size of the land and ignored the productivity. Under this situation, there might cause an economic gap based on the different size of land and the productivity of land. </p>


	<p id="one"> Crampton and Krygier provided an introduction of critical cartography. They stated that critical cartography challenges academic cartography by linking geographic knowledge with power. As well as map was an abstraction from concrete reality which was designed and motivated by practical concerns. In the 20th century, cartography focused on how maps could be applied to solve socio-political problems. But now, mapping is no longer in the hands of the experts, there is a growing opportunity for everyone to create the maps. However, political, and racial factors can be the concern when everyone can create maps and use the open data. </p>
