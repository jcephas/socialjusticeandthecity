    <p>Scott argued that the most tragic episodes of state-initiated social engineering originate in a pernicious combination of <ins><b>four elements</b></ins>. In the chapter of “Nature and Space,” Scott began with the story of scientific forestry in Germany in the eighteenth century. He stated the unsuccessful idea of planned forestry spread to the worldwide and the result was devastating. However, planning and measurement became a desirable activities in some countries. As the states were focusing on tax collection, they ignored the land and its people. The tax collection was based on the size of the land and ignored the productivity. Under this situation, there might cause an economic gap based on the different size of land and the productivity of land.</p>
    <p> Crampton and Krygier provided an introduction of critical cartography. They stated that critical cartography challenges academic cartography by linking geographic knowledge with power. As well as map was an abstraction from concrete reality which was designed and motivated by practical concerns. In the 20th century, cartography focused on how maps could be applied to solve socio-political problems. But now, mapping is no longer in the hands of the experts. </p>

    <p2 id="demo" style="display:none">The first element is “administrative ordering of nature and society.” The second element is a high-modernist ideology, which is a strong, version of the self-confidence about scientific and technical progress, the expansion of production, the growing satisfaction of human needs, the mastery of nature and the rational design of social order commensurate with the scientific understanding of natural laws. The third element is an authoritarian state that is willing and able to use the full weight of its coercive power to bring these high-modernist designs into being. And the last element is a prostrate civil society that lacks the capacity to resist these plans.</p2>
