    <p> “The state” described by James Scott is used throughout the Nature and State in a way view the relationship between the people and the centralized authority aimed at creating a uniform society best enabling taxation, and governance. Scott’s comparison of forestry management gives a lens to which it is easier to visualize and interpret the states attempts at creating a administratively managed society. Similar to how difficult it is to manage a forest, with disregard to ecology, social environments are just as messy. The examination of forestry management formulated terms such as “weeds”, “pests”, “brush” and “predators” in describing parts of the forest that were not of commodity value. However, it is only through this lens to which these are seen as such. In other implications these classifications hold greater value but from the states perspective with an intent on gains, control, and commodification, the terms are accepted. The same is true for social order where cadastral mapping categorizes land, people, into simplified legible form primarily for taxation purpose. The disregard and simplicity of mapping has disregards or places less value on specific social topics, where history has proven to use to advantages.

Contemporary cartography as provided by Jeremy Crampton rejects the notion of political mapping describes by Scott and shows how critical cartography better understands the context of a particular map. New mapping systems today debark from a centralized political agency invested in power dynamics and instead give people the ability to map and use local knowledge in compiling a collaborative cohesive map. It is through open source mapping and critical cartography that a complex narrative can be more accurately portrayed.
